In this folder are the exercises for the Python homework for the Rice Bootcamp, June 2020.
There are folders for each exercise:

Heroes Of Pymoli folder contains HeroesOfPymoli_Ross_Davidson.ipynb, which is the primary code to run.
Each folder contains a Resources folder, with source data. The code reaches for that path.
In sub-folders there is practise code.
